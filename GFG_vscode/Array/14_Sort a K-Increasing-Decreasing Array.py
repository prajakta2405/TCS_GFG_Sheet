Given a K-increasing-decreasing array arr[], the task is to sort the given array. 
An array is said to be K-increasing-decreasing if elements repeatedly increase upto a certain index after which they decrease,
then again increase, a total of K times. The diagram below shows a 4-increasing-decreasing array.

 

Input: arr[] = {57, 131, 493, 294, 221, 339, 418, 458, 442, 190} 
Output: 57 131 190 221 294 339 418 442 458 493
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1} 
Output: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4
